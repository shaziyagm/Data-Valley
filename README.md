Arrays:

1)write a java code for sorting an array, and find number of occurrences of a particular number in java.
2)write a java code to find the maximum element in array.

Polymorphism

1)Create a base class Animal with a method makeSound(). Create two derived classes Dog and Cat that 
override the makeSound() method. Illustrate runtime polymorphism by creating objects of both derived 
classes and invoking the method.

2)Create a Java class with overloaded methods for addition (add) that can accept two 
integers, three doubles, and two strings, respectively. Demonstrate the usage of these methods in the 
main method by adding two integers, three doubles, and concatenating two strings
